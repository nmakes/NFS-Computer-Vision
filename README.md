NFS-Computer-Vision
===================

A project demonstrating the use of Computer Vision in Human Computer Interaction, especially in gaming

This is a simple project which uses Computer Vision to detect a colored game controller. Information is extracted from the game controller such as its apparent size and orientation, based on which input signals are sent to a car racing game (Need for Speed Most Wanted).

It consists of two parts, the first of which is the Programs folder which contains the two main programs, two utility programs, an executable and a dll file. The other part contains sample code for tutorials to understand how the Computer Vision program works.

This project is part of the Technology Incubator Program - BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus and has been created for students to learn about an interesting application of Computer Vision in Human Computer Interaction.
