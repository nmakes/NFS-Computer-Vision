NFS-Computer-Vision
===================

A project demonstrating the use of Computer Vision in Human Computer Interaction, especially in gaming

This is a simple project which uses Computer Vision to detect a colored game controller. Information is extracted from the game controller such as its apparent size and orientation, based on which input signals are sent to a car racing game (Need for Speed Most Wanted). You can watch a video of an early version of the project here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBfYVfCywu4

It consists of two parts, the first of which is the Programs folder which contains the two main programs, two utility programs, an executable and a dll file. The other part contains sample code for tutorials to understand how the Computer Vision program works. Go through the Instructions.txt file to get the programs working or go through the Tutorials folder to learn how the code works

This project is part of the Technology Incubator Program - BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus and has been created for students to learn about an interesting application of Computer Vision in Human Computer Interaction.
