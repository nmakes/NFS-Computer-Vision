This is a set of tutorials on how to use SimpleCV for basic Computer Vision.
This is by no means a general tutorial on SimpleCV, it focuses mainly on the project and it's core
part - Color Segmentation. So in a way you can consider it to be an introduction to Color
Segementation and applying that concept in a real life application.

Once you have mastered the basics, this tutorial will explain how the code in the project works.
I am assuming that everyone reading this basic guide is familiar with python.

SimpleCV is a collection of python programs which make it easy to use OpenCV's python bindings.
You can find out more about it here http://simplecv.org/
There are a lot of samples and tutorials out there for you to refer to.

There is also an ebook which you can refer to for more details.
It is called Practical Computer Vision with SimpleCV and you can get it at the following site -

Do refer to it if you need clarification on the syntax.
You can also check out the docs at http://simplecv.org/docs/ for exact details on all the functions
