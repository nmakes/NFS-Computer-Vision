				SIMULATING KEY PRESSES WITH C#
===================================================================================================

This is the final tutorial in this 7 part series. An important note to everyone, this part deals
with a C# program. If you are familiar with Java or C++ this shouldn't be too difficult to follow
but it will be a bit alien if you are more comfortable with Python. I don't really know C# but I do
know Java and from what I've seen, the syntax is quite similar. It is also important to note that
we will be using two external libraries. The first is a dll file called InputManager.dll which
we will be using to simulate keyboard input although it is capable of a lot more. I got it online
here http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/117657/InputManager-library-Track-user-input-and-simulate
and you can read about how to use it online in case you wish to use some of the other functions.
The other external piece of code we'll be using is something called MicroTimer, a class used for
microsecond timing which is crucial for our application. You can read more about it here - 
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/98346/Microsecond-and-Millisecond-NET-Timer I didn't write this
class, I am merely using it in my program and I had to look at some of the examples online to learn
how to use it. So in a way you can also treat this as an exercise in examining a new language and
learning to use code written by others by looking at the documentation and examples. Like I said
earlier, I don't really know C# but I will do the best I can to explain it to you. If you'd like
to learn more about the language you can do so here - http://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/

Perhaps I should take a moment to explain why I'm using C# when the rest of the code is written in
python (because I like python and it's easy to use). The crux of the issue lies with the way in
which keystrokes are simulated. You see, to translate our control signals into keystrokes, we have 
to use some API to simulate keyboard input and there are several excellent python modules out there
like PyKeyboard which do exactly that. I have used PyKeyboard and it works beautifully. Why then am
I not using it here? I was stumped for a while when I tried unsuccessfully so many times to make it
work and googled a lot of stuff until I finally found the answer. The simple explanation is that
the keystrokes simulated by PyKeyboard are virtual and computer games like NFS are built using
DirectX which has it's own way of accepting keyboard input. This makes it difficult to fool the
game into thinking that a key has been pressed because it tends to ignore virtual keystrokes. So
somehow we have to simulate input in such a way that DirectX doesn't ignore it. After searching a
bit, I found the C# InputManager library online and decided to use it as a last resort. That's why
we're going to be using C# and not python for this particular application. If anyone knows how to
simulate DirectX level keyboard input in python, I'd be really grateful if you'd tell me how.

Before we get around to looking at the code, perhaps it would be better if were to explain the
algorithm first. As you know, the python program "control.py" is responsible for extracting the
size and angle of the controller, generating a control signal and writing it to a temporary file.
The C# program has to read the file and simulate the key presses according to the control signal.
There are a couple of functions which we will use for that, one to press the key and one to release
the key. Just for reference, they are called "KeyDown()" and "KeyUp()" and we'll get to them later.

So anyway, we now have a way of simulating key presses, we need an algorithm to determine when to
press the keys and when to release them. The algorithm to press the UP arrow key is easy enough.
Read the first line of the the file and extract the first character. If it's a zero then release
the key. If it's a zero and the key was already released, do nothing. If it's a one then press the
key and if it's already been pressed, do nothing. Simple enough. But the algorithm for pressing the
left and right arrow keys is not that straightforward. It's easy to extract the second and third 
characters of the first line and figure out whether to turn right or left. But correlating the
sharpness of the turn to the angle by which the controller was turned is a bit harder. Remember the
second line of the control signal was a percentage? It's just a measure of how sharp the turn is
where 100 means keep the LEFT or RIGHT arrow key pressed continuously and 0 means keep it released.
So what then would 50 mean? It would probably mean that we have to take a gentle turn. If a real
player had to take a gentle turn, he wouldn't keep the key pressed all the time. He'd just tap it
gently again and again for varying time intervals. So maybe 50 means that the key should be pressed
for some time and then released for an equal interval of time. So if the value is x, we should keep
the key pressed for some x units of time and then release it for 100-x units of time. Not only that
but this process has to be repeated again and again at a high frequency in order to average out
the effects of pressing and releasing the keys. What does that mean? Take a case where the power
percentage is 50. Let's say that I keep the key pressed for 5 seconds and release it for 5 seconds.
Theoretically it should give me the desired result but practically it results in extremely jerky
motion. But what if I keep the key pressed for 0.05 seconds and release it for 0.05 seconds. Now
the motion is no longer jerky, it is smooth and controlled. This is something called PWM or Pulse
Width Modulation. Read about it here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation

It should be noted that performance improves when the frequency of modulation is higher. In the
first example I gave, the time period was 10 seconds so frequency was 0.1 Hz which from a PWM point
of view SUCKS. The second example had a time period of 0.1 seconds and frequency 10 Hz which is not
good enough but a 100 times better than 0.1 Hz. We need something like 100 Hz for good performance
and achieving that isn't easy. 100 Hz means a time period of 10 milliseconds. Lets say I give a
percentage of 1 as my input signal. It means that I'd have to press the key for 0.1 milliseconds
and release it for 9.9 milliseconds. So I need to be able to measure time with an accuracy of at
least 100 micro seconds which isn't easy since Windows isn't a real time operating system. C# 's 
built in functions can measure upto 1 millisecond which just isn't good enough. So I searched for a
way to measure time with greater accuracy in C# and I found the MicroTimer library which somehow
manages to achieve microsecond timing. I'm not sure how it does this and although it isn't always
accurate, it works most of the time which is good enough for this project.

So the plan now is to use the MicroTimer library to call a function every 100 micro seconds. This
When the function is called 100 times, we can say that one cycle is complete since 10 milliseconds
will have elapsed and that results in a frequency of 100 Hz. Every time this function is called, we
increment a certain count variable to measure how many times the function has been called and if the
cycle is complete or not. Now lets assume that my percentage is 73 (some random value). In the very
first cycle, the function presses down the key (Left or Right depending on the control string). In
each subsequent call to the function, the count variable is incremented and the function checks if
73 calls are over. If they are, the key is released. For the next 27 calls to the function, nothing
happens, the current state is maintained. Once 100 calls to the function are complete, the program
reads the text file again, gets the percentage from it and the cycle starts again. So what have we
accomplished here? We have a system that pressed the key down for 7.3 milliseconds and released it
for 2.7 milliseconds. That gives us a nice smooth input in the game. And this system will work for
any arbitrary integer between 0 and 100.

Now that we've got the preliminaries out of the way, lets examine the code line by line.
Open up "Program.cs" in Notepad++ or MS Visual Studio and check it out.
The first 4 lines are all about using things. We've got code like "using System" etc and it's kinda
interesting. Basically the stuff that we are "using" are called namespaces which are like a bunch
of libraries of pre written code, not unlike using the import statement in python where we import
a bunch of stuff like SimpleCV, or time or math etc. So when I type "using System" I'm basically
telling the C# compiler that I want to use all the functions present in the System library. C++
users will be familiar with the concept of namespaces and it is exactly the same here. Java coders
can consider a namespace to be like a package and "using namespace xyz" is similar to importing
those packages.

So what's inside these namespaces? Honestly I don't know but a quick google search will tell you all
you need to know. The "System" namespace is used in several places. It is used for the basic input
and output operations like accepting user input and printing results on screens. It is also used to
define the String and Boolean data types and also contains the Exception class which is used in try
catch blocks to handle errors in the program. It is also has the Convert.toInt32() function which
converts a string to an integer.

The "System.Windows.Forms" namespace is used to define certain keys which we will be passing as
arguments to the functions which simulate keyboard input. The functions in question are the
Keyboard.KeyUp() and Keyboard.KeyDown() functions which happen to be inside the InputManager
namespace which in turn is part of InputManager.dll . So if you want to run this program, you will
need that dll file to be present. The last namespace that we will be using is "System.IO" which is
used in the file reading part of the program. It is also important to note that we will be defining
our own namespace NFSKeys since we are using the external MicroTimer class which also has to be in
the same namespace and this fact is indicated on line 6.

Everything in C# and Java has to be in a class (even if it's not needed like this case). So this is
a class Program which we are defining. In C# and Java, the class which has to have a main() function
which is called automatically when the compiled executable is run. Lets move on and look at some of
the variables that we are defining. There are a lot of them, and their use will become apparent
later on. Note that they are all static variables and if you don't know what a static variable is,
never mind although you can read about it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable

Moving on to our main function, we have a simple statement on line 20 which as you can no doubt
guess is used for printing "Staring program" to the console. It is equivalent to the print statement
in python. The next few lines are extremely important. Line 22 creates a new MicroTimer object mt
which we will be using for microsecond timing. The next line assigns a callback function to this
MicroTimer object. If you look at the code, there is a function called ButtonPress on line 72.
This ButtonPress function is assigned as a callback to the MicroTimer object. It is worth noting
that a callback function is a function that is only called when a certain event occurs. You will
come across callback functions in a lot of event driven programs like GUI programs, android
programming or socket programming and even embedded C for AVR robots. So what is the event here? It
a periodic event that is triggered at a fixed time interval. The next line sets that interval for
the MicroTimer object as 100 microseconds and the line after that starts the timer.

Let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture and see what's going on. Basically we have
configured a MicroTimer object. This object is designed in such a way that we can set an interval
for the timer in microseconds. At the end of each interval, the callback function assigned to the
MicroTimer object "ButtonPress" is called. Essentially what's happening is that we have made a timer
which runs the "ButtonPress" function every 100 microseconds. So now we've got a periodic function
called "ButtonPress" which is called every 100 microseconds. What does "ButtonPress" do? Well it's
the function that actually implements the pulse width modulation part and is responsible for 
pressing and releasing the buttons for the right duration of time. So maybe we should take a closer
look at the "ButtonPress" function (just ignore the parameters, not sure what they do).

It's really quite straightforward. Every time the function is called, the count variable's value is
incremented by one. Lets assume that the percentage is 73. On the first call, the first if 
statement is satisfied and the key is pressed. The key press is done with the KeyBoard.KeyDown()
function. The next 72 calls nothing happens as none of the conditions are satisfied because it is an
intermediate phase. However once 73 calls to the function are made, the else if condition on line 85
is satisfied and the key is released. After that the next few calls have no effect since none of the
conditions is satisfied until the count crosses 100 and once that happens the cycle is complete.

Back to the main function now. If you skip ahead to line 27, you can see that we have the main loop
of the program. On line 29 we have the beginning of the try block, just the way we had it in python
because there may be clashes if both programs try to access the file simultaneously and we just want
to ignore such cases as they are not very frequent. Lines 29 and 30 deal with opening a file stream
for reading and writing. I know that it's much easier to do this in python using the open() function
but it's a bit more complicated in C# and Java. An important point to note is that C# by default
implements something called file locking and Python does not. Basically what it means is that if C#
has opened the file for writing, Python cannot open the file to write to it. Annoying isn't it?
Well that's why we have to disable file locking in line 29 by specifying the "FileShare.ReadWrite"
attribute. That way both programs can access the same file with much fewer clashes.

The next few lines just read the first two lines from the file. The control signals are then
extracted from these two lines and stored in some variables. The PWM percentage is converted to an
integer using the Convert.toInt32() function in the C# System namespace. After the control signals
have been extracted, they can be used for the key press simulation part. The main loop of the
program is where the UP arrow key presses are simulated. Since PWM is not required here, they can be
a part of the main loop. The state variable is used just to check if the key was already pressed or
already released since there is no point in calling the KeyBoard.KeyDown() or KeyBoard.KeyUp()
functions again.

What happens after that is a bit more interesting. You have to realise that when MicroTimer calls
the ButtonPress() function, it does so asynchronously. That means that the running of the main loop
goes on simultaneously during the execution of the ButtonPress() function without being interrupted
at all! But we don't want the main loop to execute at its natural pace, we want it to wait until
a cycle is complete after which a new control string can be read. So the main loop has to pause
for approximately 10 milliseconds while the ButtonPress() cycle executes. The easiest way to do
that is by running an empty while loop on line 54 until the cycle is complete. Once the cycle is
completed, the loop breaks allowing the program's execution to continue. At the end of a cycle,
the only thing left to do is reset the variables. Lines 59 - 62 do just that and reset their values
for the next cycle.

That's a really really long explanation of a program and I'm sure you're tired after reading it.
If you've made it this far, congratulations for your perseverance, I know it couldn't have been
easy. You are now ready to go ahead and test out the code. There are instructions on how to run the
codes in the main folder and you can learn how to make the controller there as well. Do take a 
video of yourself playing the game and post it on the BITS TIP page or let me know on facebook.
I hope that you learnt something new and interesting and that you will take this knowledge forward
and apply it elsewhere.
