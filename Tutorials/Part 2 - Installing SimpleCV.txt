					INSTALLING SimpleCV
===================================================================================================

The easiest way to install SimpleCV on Windows is by downloading the SimpleCV superpack.
Get it here http://simplecv.org/download and click on SimpleCV Version 1.3 Superpack.
The link will take you to sourceforge where the download will begin automatically

The name of the file is SimpleCV-1.3.msi and it's about 192 MB in size.
Once it's downloaded, just sit and run it. It needs to install a whole bunch of stuff so let it do
that. Just keep clicking next - next and so on and finish the install.

Very important note - You need to be connected to the internet during the installation procedure.
The installer has to download several files from github and WILL NOT GIVE WARNINGS if you are not
connected to the internet. It will just say done and quit.

Now comes the moment of truth. Open up the command prompt (press START + R and type cmd) and
type python. In all likelihood, you will get an error saying that it is not recognised as a
valid command or batch file. No matter. You have to set the environment variables so that python
is recognised by the system

In case you are wondering where python came from, let me tell you that it was part of the superpack
and was installed automatically along with a lot of other stuff during the installation.

Anyway back to the environment variable thing. First go to C:\Python27 and check that python.exe
is present there. If not, something went horribly wrong and you'll have to start from scratch
(don't worry it's very unlikely)

Now do this - right click on My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
or go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables

There's that part about System Variables and there's one called 'Path' which needs to be edited.
PLEASE BE CAREFUL HERE WHILE EDITING THE Path VARIABLE DON'T DELETE ITS CONTENTS BY ACCIDENT

After the last entry add a semicolon ';' (the quotes are just to highlight, don't put them too)
After the semicolon type 'C:\Python27' (again, without the quotes)
So the final result should look like  "some_random_stuff_blah_blah; C:\Python27" (No quotes)
Once it's done, apply the settings and close everything.
Open up a NEW command prompt window (close the old ones) and type python.
It should work now

If it doesn't, then you haven't set the path correctly. Restart your system, try typing python
again, if it still doesn't work then check the whole environment variable part again
and make sure that C:\Python27\python.exe works and try setting the environment variables again.

Now for the next part. Checking the SimpleCV install. It's quite simple really.
Type python in the cmd prompt. You should see some stuff and then >>>
now try the following commands

import SimpleCV
print SimpleCV.__version__

if it prints 1.3.0 you are good to go.

If it gives an error while importing SimpleCV (which it probably will) do the following

Read the error message and see which python module is missing

Check if it truly is missing. Go to C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages and look at the folder names
If there is no folder called numpy, scipy, pygame, PIL etc then something is wrong

Download that module from the internet and install it manually (please google and use your head)
If it's still beyond you then get in touch with me.

Some people might be facing trouble with PIL (python imaging library)
PIL is installed by SimpleCV but the name of the installed folder isn't just PIL, there
are some more letters, numbers and hyphens after it. DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH THE PIL FOLDER
THAT HAS ".egg" IN ITS NAME, THAT'S A DIFFERENT FOLDER, DO NOT CHANGE ITS NAME.
Change the name of the other PIL folder to just 'PIL' (without the quotes')

Restart your system for good measure and try importing SimpleCV again and it should work.
