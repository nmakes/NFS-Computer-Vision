My observations show that using an external webcam is always better than using the internal webcam.

There are two disadvantages with the internal webcam

1) On my Dell laptop, I cannot use the webcam at 640 x 480 resolution
   I keep getting the error "ERROR - SampleCB buffer sizes do not match"
   Probably some issue with the Dell webcam driver.
   
2) The colors are washed out as if there is a gray fog in front of the camera.
   Also the frame rate is extremely poor even in excellent lighting conditions
   Unless I directly shine a light at it, I don't get more than 15 FPS as compared
   to a crisp 30 FPS on my external USB webcam.
   
I currently use a Microsoft Lifecam VX-700 that's about several years old and cost about Rs. 1000
It's not the best in the world but certainly way better than the built in one.
